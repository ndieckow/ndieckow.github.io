# The Impact of AGI on Different Careers
Whether you like it or not, generative AI, especially in the form of large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, is developing rapidly and unless there are unexpected slowdowns, artificial general intelligence (AGI) is around the corner. In this blog post, I want to investigate how I expect different careers to be affected by this development. Note that I am not an expert in any of the careers, so this is entirely my opinion, which may be completely misguided. I will group these by *most affected*, *medium affected* and *barely affected*. There is no *not affected*, because no matter what you do, you will likely come into contact with some form of AI.

Before we start, I want to give a simple definition of AGI that I will adopt for this post: By AGI, I mean **a system that is capable of using our human-developed ways of reasoning and taking it to its limits**. Or in other words: Any problem that could be solved by the smartest possible human, given enough time, can be solved by this system, probably in much less time. This is probably not the best definition of it. There are much more sophisticated attempts at defining intelligence, one of which I will link [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01547). I also want to emphasize that AGI has nothing to do with robotics.

## Most Affected

These are probably the first to have their jobs eventually be replaced by AGI.

### Knowledge Workers
Any job that requires thinking can be outsourced to an AGI. Some knowledge jobs are arguably more affected than others. Writers will be some of the first to go, which we can already see now. Some of the last will likely be scientists, although it depends on the kind of science: The first to go are the ones whose work consists of pure writing, such as mathematicians and philosophers. Directly after that, we have computer scientists. Current LLMs are already very good at writing code. Running experiments might still be a hurdle, but in the long run it should not be an obstacle. Performing real life experiments (such as in biology or chemistry) is a task for robotics and therefore not affected by AGI.

## Medium Affected


## Barely Affected

#### Athletes
The only thing AI will be able to do here is generate videos of athletic performances or games. Those who only care about watching sports on the TV might therefore stop giving money to this industry, but there will always be people coming to games or other performances in person. Overall, this is similar to musicians, although the latter a more affected.

## Conclusion
What does a developed nation with access to AGI look like?
