The word *tool* is very ubiquitous. In the everyday sense, we think of something like a hammer or a wrench. More abstractly, it refers to a *thing* that can be used to make a particular problem more or less trivial. For instance, if drills weren't a thing, the task of putting a hole into a piece concrete would suddenly be very difficult. Not impossible, just very difficult. Suddenly, any task that involves drilling lots of holes becomes nearly impossible and we would completely have to shift our way of living to accomodate this. 

Maybe the drill example is a bit stupid and probably not very thought-through, but the point still stands: New tools are sometimes the key to a new standard and have the potential to change the game.

## Tools in Mathematics
### A Big Tool
A classic example of a tool in mathematics is *calculus*, and more concretely, derivatives.
If you didn't know about derivatives and how to calculate them, but still are interested in the rate of change of some function $f$ at a certain point $x$, you might compute $\frac{f(x+h) - f(h)}{h}$ for sufficiently small $h$ and happily obtain the result.

But what if you needed the rate of change at more than one point? Maybe 10? Maybe 100? Maybe on an entire, continuous interval? This method of manual computation is too tedious and you would likely take a different approach.

Luckily, we *do* know about derivatives and how to analytically compute them for a lot of functions of interest to us. Suddenly, taking the derivative of, say, a $d$-degree polynomial over the *entire* domain of definition is a matter of performing $d-1$ multiplications.

### A Small Tool
To mention a completely different, and much smaller, example of a tool, take the following observation.
> As $n \to \infty$, any (fixed) power of $\log n$ grows slower than $n$. In other words, for any $a \in \R_+$, $$(\log n)^a = \mathcal o(n).$$

## Discovering Tools
Once you think in terms of tools, suddenly everything appears to be one. There was a time when I thought that if obtaining a certain type of outcome was a tedious result and required significant energy expenditure, it is not something that is meant to be scaled. I nowadays believe this to be narrowminded and plain wrong, although I wouldn't be surprised if many others have this cognitive bias as well.

It is precisely these tedious processes leading to desirable outcomes, that we should investigate. Mainly in one direction: Can we make the process more efficient? Because if we can, then we have a potential new tool at hand. If not, fine, then it won't be a super handy tool, at least for now.
