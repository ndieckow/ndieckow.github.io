Sometimes, you have an idea and want to try it, but upon realizing that it can't be done in 30 minutes, you decide that it's not worth the effort. Even though it could have been a *damn* good idea.
Or perhaps you read an interesting paper, and you want to try the authors' approach on your own data (or play around with it in some other way), but just the thought of either entering a foreign codebase or writing your own implementation -- both of which would certainly take more than 30 minutes --, makes your head hurt and you decide to not "waste" any time on it. Even though it could have been a *damn* good idea.

In my opinion, the key ingredient to make this work is dedicating a certain, pre-determined amount of time to the task of making this idea/implementation work. And when the time is up, you stop working on it, regardless of whether you could make it work or not. This prevents you from going down a rabbit hole and truly wasting time you don't have.

So, my strategy (which I'm sure thousands of people before me have already thought of) would be as follows:
1. Spend 4-6 hours to make the idea work. I call this a *sprint*. Throw yourself at the problem, try every possible approach you can think of, and observe the results.
2. If you decide to continue, clean up the code and results from part 1, and write down all the ideas and tools you came up with and made use of. Then, identify what has to be done in the next sprint.

You can repeat these steps ad infinitum. The idea of separating action and reflection is nothing new. But I am nevertheless sharing it here, because I discovered it for myself and everybody's take on it is ever so slightly differnt.
